#### **Methodology**

* **Feature Engineering**: Creation of interaction terms, time-based variables, and dummy variables for categorical data.
* **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R² are used to assess model accuracy.
* **Segmentation Techniques**: Elbow method and KMeans clustering for customer grouping.
* **Coupon Redemption Modeling**: Logistic regression with recursive feature elimination to isolate key drivers.
